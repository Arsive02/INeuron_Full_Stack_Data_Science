<pre>1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 			-> Expression
'hello' 	        -> Value
-87.8  			-> Value
- 			-> Expression
/ 			-> Expression
+			-> Expression
6 			-> Value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans: A String is a datatype (an array of characters) and Variable is an entity to store values that can be used for later. Variables are stored in memory. 

3. Describe three different data types.
Ans: 
Int – Integer datatype describes the integer type data (-2147483648 through 2147483647)
Float – Decimal datatype describes the floating-point numbers (1.04, 2.0512)
Str – String datatype is an array of characters 

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans: An expression is made of mathematical operators that can perform the operations to output a definite result. Every expression leads to a value.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans: An expression evaluates the mathematical operations while statements are something that helps us to create valid instructions.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans: 22

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
Ans: spamspamspam
'spam' * 3
Ans: spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans: Because python does not allow the naming of variable to start with number.
Some valid naming conventions are: 
a 
las
As_12
Asf1

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans: int(), float(), str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans: We cannot concatenate an ‘int’ datatype directly to ‘str’. We need to either type cast the integer to string or add quotes to it.
‘I have eaten’ + str(99) + ‘burritos’
‘I have eaten’ + ‘99’ + ‘burritos’<pre>
